# Intro into Machine Learning

## Overview			
* Understand the basics of AI
* See how AI shapes our future
* Learn how to maneuver around the world of AI
* Learn different components that make up AI
* Work with real world AI Applications

## Learning Activities and Time Duration(2 hours) 

### Introduction to Machine Learning:

* Example: Use an analogy of teaching a dog new tricks (supervised learning) versus letting it figure out new tricks on its own (unsupervised learning).

### Video and Examples:

* Example: Video explaining machine learning, using common examples like predictive texting on keyboards or Netflix recommendations. Video ([Supervised Learning: Crash Course AI #2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qVRBYAdLAo&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtO65LeD2p4_Sb5XQ51par_b&index=3))

### Interactive Game:

* Example: Use Google's Teachable Machine where students can train a model to recognize different poses or objects using the webcam.

### Lab Activity:

* Example: Simple hands-on activity using Scratch to create an application that recognizes patterns or predicts outcomes based on input data. (https://teachable-arcade.glitch.me/)
