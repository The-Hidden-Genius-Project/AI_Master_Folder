# THE HIDDEN GENIUS PROJECT X CS FOR ALL "CS GAMES 2024"

### 1. Robotics Relay Race
**Overview:**
- **Objective:** Teams program robots to complete a series of tasks in a relay format, passing 'batons' (or triggering events) as they progress through each segment of the course.
- **Components:**
  - **Course Design:** The course is divided into several segments, each featuring different challenges like obstacle navigation, object manipulation, or maze-solving.
  - **Robots:** Participants use Sphero Robots, and drive those robots through The Sphero app on Ipad.
  - **Relay Transitions:** At the end of each segment, the robot must pass off the task to the next robot or trigger a mechanism that allows the next robot to start(for Example bumping or knocking over gate).

**Skills Emphasized:**
- Robotics engineering and understanding
- Navigation and control algorithms
- Teamwork and Strategic planning

### 2. AI Automated Track Driving
**Overview:**
- **Objective:** Develop and train artificial intelligence (AI) models to autonomously drive vehicles around a racetrack as quickly and safely as possible.
- **Components:**
  - **Track:** A physical or virtual racetrack with various turns, obstacles, and environmental conditions.
  - **Vehicles:** Autonomous vehicles, Sphero RVR Rovers, will be used equipped with color detection
  - **AI Models:** Participants implement machine learning or reinforcement learning algorithms to control the vehicle's speed, direction, and obstacle avoidance.

**Skills Emphasized:**
- Machine learning and neural network training
- Sensor data interpretation and integration
- Real-time decision making and control systems

### 3. AI Design Thinking
**Overview:**
- **Objective:** Engage in a creative problem-solving process to design innovative AI solutions for given real-world challenges.
- **Components:**
  - **Problem Statements:** Participants receive challenges relevant to fields like healthcare, environment, education, or transportation.
  - **Ideation Phase:** Teams brainstorm and propose AI-driven solutions, considering feasibility, impact, and ethical implications.
  - **Prototyping and Presentation:** Teams develop prototypes of their solutions, create presentations, and demonstrate their concepts to a panel of judges.

**Skills Emphasized:**
- Design thinking methodology
- Interdisciplinary knowledge application
- Collaboration, communication, and ethical considerations

### Event Structure and Scoring
**Competition Phases:**
1. **Initial Briefing:** Overview and rules explanation, ensuring all participants understand the event's format and objectives.(5 Minutes)
2. **Development Period:** Time allocated for teams to work on their robots, AI models, and design solutions.(20 Minutes)
3. **Testing and Trials:** Opportunity for participants to test their robots on the track, refine AI models, and iterate on design thinking solutions.(10 Minutes)
4. **Final Competition:** Formal evaluation and competition across the categories:
   - **Robotics Relay Race:** Timed runs, accuracy in task completion, and relay transitions.
   - **AI Automated Track Driving:** Lap times, error rates, and overall driving performance.
   - **AI Design Thinking:** Innovation, practicality, and presentation quality.

**Judging and Awards:**
- Judges TBD
- Criteria include performance, creativity, technical complexity, and overall impact.
- Awards for top performers in each category and recognitions for creativity, teamwork, and innovation.

### Conclusion
The Computer Science Games provide a platform for students to showcase their technical skills, creativity, and collaborative abilities. By participating in events like robotics relay races, AI automated track driving, and AI design thinking, individuals not only compete but also learn and advance the field of computer science through innovation and teamwork.
